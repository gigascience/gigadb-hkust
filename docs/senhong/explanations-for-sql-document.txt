1. WITHOUT OIDS
This optional clause specifies whether rows of the new table should have OIDs (object identifiers) assigned to them. The default is to have OIDs. (If the new table inherits from any tables that have OIDs, then WITH OIDS is forced even if the command says WITHOUT OIDS.)

Specifying WITHOUT OIDS allows the user to suppress generation of OIDs for rows of a table. This may be worthwhile for large tables, since it will reduce OID consumption and thereby postpone wraparound of the 32-bit OID counter. Once the counter wraps around, uniqueness of OIDs can no longer be assumed, which considerably reduces their usefulness. Specifying WITHOUT OIDS also reduces the space required to store the table on disk by 4 bytes per row of the table, thereby improving performance.

2. ALTER TABLE ONLY
If ONLY is specified, only that table is altered. If ONLY is not specified, the table and all its descendant tables (if any) are updated. * can be appended to the table name to indicate that descendant tables are to be altered, but in the current version, this is the default behavior. (In releases before 7.1, ONLY was the default behavior. The default can be altered by changing the configuration parameter sql_inheritance.)

3. All the names of tables and attributes are lowercase. 
Because in postgresql, if you want to present names containing capital letters, you should use the quoted-names in SQL statements. It's not convenient for ones who want to select data from the database, so all the names of tables and attributes are lowercase.
